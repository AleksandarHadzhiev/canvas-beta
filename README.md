# canvas-beta

## Introduction

A small version of the Canvas by Instructure website. The project aims to allow different education institutes to provide their
lesson materials and grades in an online format. So that the students invited by them can browse them in the internet. The backend of the application
will be created in python (FastAPI) for the backend and Next.js for the frontend of the application and SQL DB from the `sqlmodel`, which works well with FastAPI.
